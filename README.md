# PassionProjectTwo
A rebuilt PASSION PROJECT assignment

Passion project for Mobile Development course at Humber Web Development.

This project is based around the MMORPG "World of Warcraft". This project will assist players that have multiple characters in choosing a PvP composition to step into the arena with.
There are two tables associated with this project. "Classes" and "Comps", to bring this project up to a more advanced level, I would need to create a many-to-many relationship between the two tables.




Project is done using Visual Studio entityframework and a code-first approach.

A reference project that has been used was created by Developer Christine Bittle. https://github.com/christinebittle/varsityproject
